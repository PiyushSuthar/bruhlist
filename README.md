# Bruhlist
Trying to (not exactly) clone [Anilist](https://anilist.co/user/piyushsthr/).

## Stack
As for backend,
- Typescript
- Express (I couldn't setup @tinyhttp/app with apollo-graphql, perhaps I might make some fix for it soon.)
- type-graphql
- type-orm (i might change it with [Deta Base](https://deta.sh), it's free and awesome hahaha.)
- checkout package.json for more hehe

And for frontend, I might go with NextJS or PreactJS. Who knows i might even go with sveltekit hahaha... lemme release backend mvp first <3

## Run Locally
I prefer using pnpm, so you just install it if you haven't.

Clone this repo on your machine and run this command.

(for dev server)
```sh
cd server && pnpm dev
```

(for prod server)
```sh
cd server && pnpm start
```

I also need to improve file structure of the project. I might setup workspace and all... perhaps even make an andriod app using react-native or flutter.

> The instructions might change with time as I'll be working on this as a side project (obviously for scientific purposes).

Thanksss for scrolling down here!! Hopefully i'll actually build all the stuff i've mentioned hahahaa.
